# tictactoe
Program that learns on its own to play TicTacToe. The initial algorithm that is implemented (check play_AI_learn in util.py) is based on the matchbox AI system by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Michie.
Instead of storing all the states of the board, the program adds any new state to a record dictionary and initializes the record dictionary.
